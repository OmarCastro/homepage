    <h2>AR Fruit Samurai</h2>

    A game based on augmented reality where you cut virtual fruits with that come from a basket, a virtual sword, which in reality is made of paper, unfortunately, to enjoy the game you had to have a high frame-rate camera, because you may pass a fruit without cutting it due to sheer swing speed and a low framerate camera, I played with a smartphone camera, so I know how it feels.
