    <h2>Shellhive</h2> 
     A collaborative realtime application to create big data tasks using UNIX tools. The processing workflow is formed by
making typed connections, avoiding possible errors such as infinite loops by creating cycles in the dataflow. The workflow can be created or managed using the dataflow GUI, or using text code that should be compatible with UNIX Shell. The application can be used to study about the potential usage of the command line interface because it is secure enough to prevent the execution of unwanted code, and that the working environment is isolated thanks to Docker.<br><br>

    <h2>AR Fruit Samurai</h2>
    A game based on augmented reality where you cut virtual fruits thatcomes from a virtual basket using a virtual sword, which in reality ismade of paper. Unfortunately, to enjoy the game you need a high frame-rate camera, because you may pass a fruit without cutting it due to sheer swing speed and a low frame-rate camera, I tested with a smartphone camera.
