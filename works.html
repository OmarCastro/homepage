    <h2>AR Fruit Samurai</h2>

    A game based on augmented reality where you cut virtual fruits thatcomes from a virtual basket using a virtual sword, which in reality ismade of paper. Unfortunately, to enjoy the game you need a high frame-rate camera, because you may pass a fruit without cutting it due to sheer swing speed and a low frame-rate camera, I tested with a smartphone camera.
